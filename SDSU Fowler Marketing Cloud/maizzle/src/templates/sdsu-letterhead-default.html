      <p>Dear %%First Name%%,</p>
      <p>Hello! This is %%=v(@ownerFirstName)=%% %%=v(@ownerLastName)=%% from San Diego State University, just checking in with you again about our Bachelor of Science in Business Administration Online Degree Completion Program.</p>
      <p>Remember, the application window for fall 2021 is now open. If you still have questions about the program, I’d like to reconnect and see if I can help you plan the next steps in your academic journey. I wouldn’t want you to miss out on your opportunity to apply and begin classes later this year.</p>
      <p>This degree-completion program will give you an opportunity to earn the same Business degree as on-ground SDSU students in just two years. The program is fully online and taught by the same faculty and lecturers that teach on-campus courses at the esteemed SDSU Fowler College of Business.</p>
      <p>If you've completed the required courses with 60 or more units and completed all the prerequisites and admission requirements, we'd love to have you apply for the program.</p>
      <p>If you'd like more information about the program, including a full list of admission requirements and detailed application instructions, please visit neverstoplearning.net/onlinebusiness. You can also contact me by calling %%=v(@ownerPhone)=%%, by email at <a href="mailto:%%=v(@ownerEmail)=%%">%%=v(@ownerEmail)=%%</a>, or you can find time on my calendar by clicking here: <a href="%%=v(@ownerCalendar)=%%">%%=v(@ownerCalendar)=%%</a>.</p>
